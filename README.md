Hybrid Virtual Memory Manager - CSE316 Continuous Assessment 2
================================================================

Project Name:
    Hybrid Virtual Memory Manager

Subject:
    Operating System (CSE316)

Continuous Assessment:
    Continuous Assessment 2

Description:
-------------
This repository contains a simulation project for a Hybrid Virtual Memory Manager,
designed as part of the Operating Systems course (CSE316). The project simulates
a virtual memory manager that combines paging and segmentation to optimize memory
usage. It implements several page replacement algorithms, including:

  - FIFO (First-In, First-Out)
  - LRU (Least Recently Used)
  - LFU (Least Frequently Used)
  - OPT (Optimal with Lookahead)
  - WS (Working Set)

The simulation is implemented in C++ and is designed to run as a console-based
application, providing text output that details memory accesses, page faults,
and algorithm-specific statistics.

Project Structure:
------------------
- COSC 3360 - Assignment3.sln
    Visual Studio solution file containing the complete project.
- COSC 3360 - Assignment3.vcxproj & COSC 3360 - Assignment3.vcxproj.filters
    Visual Studio C++ project files with build configurations and file organization.
- OS_HW3_Chad_Hoang.cpp
    Main C++ source file that implements the virtual memory manager simulation.
- hw3input.txt
    Input file with simulation parameters and a list of memory access instructions.
- hw3f16.pdf
    Assignment specification and guidelines document.
- .gitignore & .gitattributes
    Git configuration files to manage repository contents and ensure consistent
    version control behavior.
- (Optional) GUI module files for interactive visualizations (if extended in the future).

Requirements:
-------------
- Visual Studio or another C++ compiler supporting C++11 (or later).
- The input file (hw3input.txt) must be accessible at runtime to supply the simulation parameters.
- (Optional) Additional libraries (e.g., Qt) if extending the project with a GUI for real-time charts/graphs.

How to Build and Run:
---------------------
1. Open the solution file (COSC 3360 - Assignment3.sln) in Visual Studio.
2. Set the path for hw3input.txt in the project's debugging settings (Command Arguments).
3. Build the solution to compile the C++ project.
4. Run the executable. The simulation will execute the various page replacement algorithms
   and output statistics (such as page faults and memory access details) to the console.

Extending the Project:
----------------------
To add interactive or visual elements (such as graphs or charts), consider these steps:
  - Refactor the simulation logic from OS_HW3_Chad_Hoang.cpp into a standalone library.
  - Create a separate GUI module using a framework like Qt that links to this library.
  - Develop an interface that allows real-time visualization of simulation data.

Requirements:
-------------
- Visual Studio or a C++ compiler supporting C++11 or later.
- Access to hw3input.txt at runtime.
- (Optional) Qt or another GUI framework for adding interactive visuals.

How to Build and Run:
---------------------
1. Open COSC 3360 - Assignment3.sln in Visual Studio.
2. Configure the debug settings to pass the path to hw3input.txt as a command-line argument.
3. Build the solution.
4. Run the executable to see simulation output in the console.

Extending the Project:
----------------------
For interactive visuals:
- Refactor the simulation logic into a separate library.
- Develop a GUI module (e.g., using Qt) that links to the simulation library.
- Implement real-time charts/graphs and interactive controls.
