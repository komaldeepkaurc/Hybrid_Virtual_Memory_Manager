    std::cout << "---------------------\n";
    std::cout << "1. Open COSC 3360 - Assignment3.sln in Visual Studio.\n";
    std::cout << "2. Configure the debug settings to pass the path to hw3input.txt as a command-line argument.\n";

    std::cout << "----------------------\n";
    std::cout << "For interactive visuals:\n";
    std::cout << " - Refactor the simulation logic into a separate library.\n";
    std::cout << " - Develop a GUI module (e.g., using Qt) that links to this library.\n";
    std::cout << " - Implement real-time charts/graphs and interactive controls.\n\n";
